The film takes as its starting point an international conference on \'Positive Energy: Creative Community Responses to Peak Oil and Climate Change\', which took place at the Findhorn Ecovillage Community in Scotlandin March 2008. It explores positive and practical solutions, with examples from the Findhorn community and Transition Town Forres that demonstratehow we can tackle food and energy production, transport, and wastewatertreatment. It also shows how a local currency can help to boost the localeconomy. \'This film is a great introduction to peak oil, resilience, and rediscovering community. It is a practical exploration of how to build resilience in a peak oil world, offering a glimpse of the possibilities ofan economic, social and cultural renaissance that is just over the horizon.\' says Maddy Harland, editor of Permaculture magazine.

Do you enjoy problem solving and making? Can you spare a few hours on a Saturday afternoon to help solve a real world development problem? <br/> <br/>One of the Centre for Global Equality\'s member organisations, Field Ready, is a start-up NGO focused on solving humanitarian supply chain problems through innovative manufacturing approaches. Aid agencies spend 60-80% of their income on procurement and logistics, yet in post-disaster responses, those in the field experience severe problems. In remote, difficult to access locations, finding unique parts â€“ replacement parts to a medical device, pieces of a vehicle or generator, custom-made rehabilitation items such as a prosthetic limb â€“ is a vital function for basic operations. However, these items are normally only available in major cities, or even only from an international supplier. The transport costs are often unjustifiable for unique or low volume components. Field Ready are seeking to solve these problems through local manufacture. In particular, we have a focus on additive manufacturing. <br/> <br/>The Make-a-thon is an event of intense brainstorming and prototyping aimed at solving a particular technical challenge. The process generally includes coming up with theoretical solutions, taking a few of them forwards to proof of concept prototyping, presenting the findings and hopefully one or more of these will serve as a basis for future development. <br/> <br/>The theme of this Makers Hackathon will be construction quality in Haiti.

If you are interested in helping, read their email below - you can sign up here. Some financial help with transport (see below). <br/> <br/>\"Hello great and good gleaners of East of England! <br/> <br/>Gleaning day coming up Thursday 8th Septemberâ€“ 10am-5pm (TBC): <br/>We\'ve discovered thousands of cabbage, broccoli and marrows going to waste on a farm near Kings Lynn- equal to 1000\'s of PORTIONS! <br/> <br/>Theyâ€™re being wasted because they are outgrades, trial crops and some just couldnâ€™t be sold. <br/> <br/>But these cabbage, marrows and broccoli are perfectly delicious and nutritious, so we\'re setting out to save as many as possible for charity, and we NEED YOUR HELP. The more volunteers we have, the more we can save! <br/> <br/>Next Thursday 8th September 10am-5pm (TBC) weâ€™re inviting volunteers to the farm to help harvest that tasty cabbage, marrows and broccoli and save them from waste, to supply food poverty charities like FareShare with beautiful food. Witness the colossal waste first-hand, and have a great social day out for a fantastic cause. Check out these photo highlights on Facebook from our gleans over the years. <br/> <br/>Unfortunately, this gleaning day is not suitable for children under the age of 18, as it involves use of harvesting knives, but we have another glean coming in the next few weeks that will be. <br/> <br/>So please spread the news to your friends and groups, by sharing this email. <br/>*** <br/>To join the gleaning day, please fill in our sign-up sheet <br/>or for more info, please contact eastengland@feedbackglobal.org <br/>*** <br/> <br/>Please get in touch ASAP so we have an idea of numbers. Also, please do check whether you can make it, as lots of drop-outs at the last minute can jeopardize the gleaning day going ahead. <br/> <br/>Travel expenses can be covered for those travelling from Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and South Lincs â€“ just check with us first (we cover up to £12 per gleaner). <br/> <br/>Here\'s some background about gleaning: <br/>Gleaning Network is on a mission to save the estimated 3 million tonnes of food that are wasted on farms every year in the UK â€“ we salvage healthy, edible fruit and vegetables that farmers cannot sell, and get it to those who need it, like homeless hostels and food poverty charities. Volunteers harvest the food in fun days out on farms, making a difference to their community and connecting with their food. We raise awareness of the causes of food waste, and campaign to design food waste out of the system, for the good of people and the planet. <br/> <br/>From our start in 2012 to the end of 2015, the Gleaning Network already gleaned over 188 tonnes of produce, equal to well over 2 million portions of fruit and veg, with over 1000 volunteers across 99 gleaning days.
